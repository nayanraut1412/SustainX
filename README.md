# SustainX
## We Turn Your Trash into Cash!

SustainX is a platform that makes the trash collection process easier for both the customer and the collector. We aim to reduce natural resource and mineral mining and give back the raw product to a centralized system, promoting a circular economy.

Global economy has traditionally followed a linear model of take-make-waste, in which resources are extracted, used once, and then discarded as waste. The most significant impact of the linear economy is the depletion of natural resources along with serious environmental impacts and massive waste generation. The Global Economy is now only 7.2% circular, leaving a huge Circularity Gap due to the absence of a centralized system for efficient trash collection, segregation, providing supply to recycling plants, and putting raw materials generated back into the economy.

The real concern regarding the environment and its overall wellbeing was the ultimate inspiration. Japan's town, Kamikatsu, with a population of 1344 people, is a waste-free city with a ‘Zero Waste Declaration’, achieved through the collaborative efforts of its residents. Replacing the take-make-dispose model with a make-use-return model to transform into a circular economy is the ultimate game-changer in saving the environment. The TEDx Talk of Cillian Lohan on Circular Economy also provided inspiration and ideas for the same.

## Project Structure:
There are two applications in the project:
1. User Side Application
2. Trash Collector Side Application

## Application Features:
1. The user of the application can register and log in to the application using two methods - Email and Google Authentication.
2. The User Side Application Home Screen has 5 features:
   a. Schedule Pickup - Let's Users schedule trash collection service.
   b. Price Enquiry - Let's Users know the current market price for Trash Categories in INR/KG.
   c. Price Your Trash - Let's Users calculate the price of their trash.
   d. My Pickups History - Let's Users view their Pickups History
   e. Image Classify your Trash - Let's Users Classify their Trash by using Image Recognition Model integrated into the application.
3. The Trash Collector Side Application Home Screen has 2 features:
   a. Completed Pickups - Let's Trash Collectors know about the number of Completed Pickups and redirects them to a more detailed view about completed pickups.
   b. Pending Pickups - Let's Trash Collectors know about the pending scheduled pickups for the day and redirects them to a list view of the pending pickups with the location of pickups which can be viewed on Google Maps.

## Technologies Used:
1. Flutter (for Application Development).
2. Google Maps API (for getting User Location).
3. Google Cloud Console (for managing the Cloud Resources and API Integration).
4. Python (for Machine Learning - Image Classification of Waste).

## Usage and Installation Guide:

Select either one of the following two options:

A. Download the APKs:
   1. [Download the Latest Version of User App](https://github.com/Ninad-Lunge/SustainX/releases/download/SustainX_V1/SustainX.apk)
   2. [Download the Latest Version of Trash Collector App](https://github.com/Ninad-Lunge/SustainX/releases/download/TrashCollector_V1/TrashCollector.apk)

B. Setup the Flutter Project:
   Note: Does not contain GMap API Keys, So the Get Location will not work.
   1. The 'master' branch of the GitHub Repository has the User Side Application Code.
   2. The 'trash_collector_side_app' branch of the GitHub Repository has the Trash Collector Side Application Code.
